            <p>Each of the collections above have the <em>same number of things</em>. That is, if we transformed all of the /*specific object*/ in the /*specific picture*/ above to red circles, we could move the circles to make all the pictures identical.</p>

           <h4>Numbers</h4>
            <p>Two collections can have this property of having the "same number of things" just as two objects can have the same color. In the same way we can describe a particular object with the color "yellow", we can describe a collection of objects with a particular number!</p>
            <p>/*Assign numbers to this quality... diagrams with "1" corresponding to "1" circle and/or "1" square, etc. (maybe give an option to alternate between the shape used to communicate this quality)... also give option to speak the numbers?*/</p>
            <p>We could keep and going up and up, but we will stop for now.</p>
            <p>The sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 is called counting. This </p>

           <p>We can decide to give the above collection that is left with no more objects a number! In particular, we give it the number "0". /*pronounciation*/</p>

           <h4>The Number-Line</h4>
            <p>It helps to keep track of all these numbers if we give them a home to live in. One home we can give to all the numbers is the <em>number-line</em>.</p>
